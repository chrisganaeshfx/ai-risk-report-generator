## Story ID
<!-- e.g. F-01, RT-03 — required, not optional -->

## Changes made to the codebase
<!-- What was added, modified, or removed. Be specific about files/modules
     touched, not just "updated server". -->

## Effects of these changes
<!-- What behaviour changes as a result — for users, for other services,
     for the API contract, for the data model, etc. Call out anything
     that could break an existing caller or teammate's in-progress work. -->

## Decisions made along the way
<!-- Any judgment calls, trade-offs, or alternatives considered while
     implementing this — especially anything not obvious from the diff
     alone. If a decision is significant enough to matter later, also
     add it to docs/DECISIONS.md in this same PR. -->
