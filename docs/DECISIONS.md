# Architecture decisions

## 2026-09-07 — Five-service microservices, not a monolith
Chose: five independently deployable services (S1–S5) across four tiers.
Rejected: modular monolith (single deployable). Reason: prof's marking rubric
explicitly requires SOA/microservices backend; microservices also give
independent scaling and fault isolation per service.
Story: F-01 (repo and branching setup).

## 2026-09-07 — Orchestration inside S4, not choreography
Chose: a single controller function in rag-service/orchestrator.py calls
retrieve → assemble → generate → guardrail-check as plain function calls.
Rejected: choreographed event-driven agents. Reason: our evaluation harness
(EV-01–EV-04) needs end-to-end trace of a single pipeline run; choreography
makes that significantly harder to reconstruct. Six-person team with limited
DevOps capacity also can't afford the message broker infrastructure.
Story: RT-01, GN-01.
